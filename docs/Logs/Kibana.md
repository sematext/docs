To visualize your data using [Kibana integrated into Logsene](http://blog.sematext.com/2015/06/11/1-click-elk-stack-hosted-kibana-4/),
you have to click on the **Kibana 4 **button next to the application's
name, from the [Logsene tab of your account](https://apps.sematext.com/ui/logs).

Once you're there, you can customize your dashboard to do all kinds of
searches and visualizations to your data.

If you want even more flexibility, you can [install Kibana locally and point it to Logsene](Logsene-FAQ/#can-i-run-kibana-4-locally-and-point-it-to-logsene).
