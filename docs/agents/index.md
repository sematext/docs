title: Sematext Agents
description: Sematext has several different Agents available for you to monitor your servers, cluster, applications and general infrastructure.

To start monitoring your infrastructure you need to set up the
appropriate Sematext monitoring agent. You can choose from:

  - [Sematext Agent](./sematext-agent/), a lightweight, blazing
    fast Go-based Monitoring Agent with a tiny footprint for both
    infrastructure and containers. It also collects metrics for various
    [integrations](../integration) using integration-specific App Agents.
    
  - [Node.js-based App Agent](./node-agent) for monitoring [Express.js](../integration/express.js), and [Node.js](../integration/node.js).

  - [Browser SDK Agent](./browser), an open source agent that is 
  	able to ship web application related metrics related to user
  	interaction.
