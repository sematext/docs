description: Supported distributions and platforms for the Sematext Agent

The Sematext Agent is designed for compatibility across all major GNU/Linux distributions and platforms. Our commitment extends to providing support throughout the entire lifecycle of distros and platforms.  

If a specific version is not listed below, Sematext Agent is still very likely to run, and we encourage you to explore its functionality on those versions.

## Linux

| Distro | Supported Versions (64-bit only) |
|:-:|:-:|
| **Ubuntu** | 18.04<br>20.04<br>22.04<br>23.10<br>24.04 |
| **Debian** | 10<br>11<br>12 |

> **Note:** We utilize eBPF technology for various functionality such as log discovery, service discovery, and system metrics collection. Please note that eBPF functionality requires a minimum **Linux kernel** version of **4.4.3**. If your kernel version is lower than 4.4.3, the Sematext Agent will still function using fallbacks. However, we strongly recommend using a host with eBPF enabled for optimal performance.
