title: Platform Support Policy

The Sematext Agent is designed for compatibility across all major GNU/Linux distributions and platforms. Our commitment extends to providing support throughout the entire lifecycle of distros and platforms. If a specific version is not listed below, running the agent may still be feasible, and we encourage you to explore its functionality on those versions.

## Linux

| Distro | Supported Versions |
|:-:|:-:|
| **Ubuntu** | 16.04<br>18.04<br>20.04<br>22.04<br>23.10 |
| **Debian** | 10<br>11<br>12 |
| **CentOS** | 6<br>7<br>8 |

| **Red Hat Enterprise Linux** | 7<br>8<br>9 |

| **Fedora Linux** | 36<br>37<br>38<br>39 |
| **openSUSE** | 15.4<br>15.5 |

**Notes:**

- Our eBPF functionality requires a minimum Linux kernel version of 4.4.2.  
- The Sematext Agent's bare-metal version is dependent on SystemD. Although using Init is still possible, we highly recommend adopting SystemD for optimal performance.
