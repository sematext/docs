## Breaking Changes

We added StatefulSets and DaemonSets metrics collection support. This new feature requires some additional cluster roles. If you're using Kubernetes and you installed the agent with `kubectl`, please update the clusterroles before upgrading your agent by running the following command:

```
kubectl apply -f https://sematext-installer.s3.amazonaws.com/sematext-clusterroles.yaml
```
