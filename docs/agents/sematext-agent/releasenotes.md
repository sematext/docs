### Action Required Changes

The new Kubernetes CronJobs monitoring requires additional cluster roles for proper functioning. If you are using Kubernetes, follow the installation method specific steps below:

#### kubectl Installation

Please re-apply `sematext-clusterroles.yaml` to your cluster.

```
kubectl apply -f https://sematext-installer.s3.amazonaws.com/sematext-clusterroles.yaml
```

After applying the new cluster roles, follow the agent upgrade steps from Sematext Cloud.

#### Helm Installation

Please update your `sematext` Helm repository.

```
helm repo add sematext https://cdn.sematext.com/helm-charts
helm repo update
```

Ensure that you have at least **1.3.0** version for the `sematext-agent` Helm package.
```

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed incorrect `Not Configured` status for the log shipper: We have resolved the issue that was causing the log shipper to display an incorrect status message.

### Action Required Changes

The new Kubernetes Components monitoring integration introduces additional cluster roles for proper functioning. If you are using Kubernetes, follow the installation method specific steps below:

#### kubectl Installation

Please re-apply `sematext-clusterroles.yaml` to your cluster.

```
kubectl apply -f https://sematext-installer.s3.amazonaws.com/sematext-clusterroles.yaml
```

After applying the new cluster roles, follow the agent upgrade steps from Sematext Cloud.

#### Helm Installation

Please update your `sematext` Helm repository.

```
helm repo add sematext https://cdn.sematext.com/helm-charts
helm repo update
```

Ensure that you have at least **1.2.1** version for the `sematext-agent` Helm package.
```
> helm search repo sematext
NAME                   	CHART VERSION	APP VERSION	DESCRIPTION                                       
sematext/sematext-agent	1.2.1        	1.0        	Helm chart for deploying Sematext Agent and Log...
```

After updating the Helm chart, follow the agent upgrade steps from Sematext Cloud.

#### hostNetwork Setting Usage

In Kubernetes, the `hostNetwork` is a configuration option that allows a container to share the network namespace of its host node. Sematext Agent requires `hostNetwork: true` setting to monitor the control plane components. By default, the `hostNetwork` setting is set to `true` starting from version 3.0.0 of Sematext Agent.

If you want to turn off `hostNetwork` access, check [our docs about hostNetwork](/docs/agents/sematext-agent/kubernetes/hostnetwork/).

#### Troubleshooting

For any errors, check our [Sematext Monitoring FAQ](/docs/monitoring/spm-faq/).

## Version 2.3.0

Date: June 6, 2023

### New Features

- MySQL logs parsing support: We have enhanced the log parsing capabilities of Sematext Agent with this update. Your log messages can now be parsed more effectively, leading to improved visibility and analysis.

### Improvements

- Improved container fields: Sematext Agent now provides more comprehensive fields for containers in Kubernetes. We have introduced the missing `container.type` field, allowing for better categorization of containers. Additionally, we have added the new `container.image.tag` field, providing valuable information about container images for improved management and identification. For details, check [our docs about tags](/docs/tags/common-schema/#container-tags).

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed nil pointer issue for MySQL and resolved broken portmatcher for MySQL: We have resolved a nil pointer issue that affected MySQL, eliminating potential errors and ensuring smooth operation. Additionally, we fixed a broken portmatcher specifically for MySQL, allowing for accurate monitoring and analysis of MySQL environments.
- Fixed connection issue to MongoDB: We have resolved the issue caused by an outdated data collector.

### Packaging and Installation

- Introduced Beta version for Sematext Agent: This release includes the ability to install the Beta version of the Sematext Agent (currently available for Debian and Ubuntu distributions only).
