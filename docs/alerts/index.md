title: Alerts Overview
description: Threshold, anomaly, and heartbeat alerts for your logs, infrastructure and user-experience metrics with email notifications and various 3rd party integrations and notification hooks such as PagerDuty, Slack and more

Alerts are used to notify you when one or more predefined conditions in your *metrics*, *logs* or *experience* data are met.  

For example, you might want to be notified when available disk space reaches a certain threshold - *metrics alert*, or when the number of logs with `severity: warning` gets too high - *logs alert*, or when your users start experiencing high response time - *experience alert*.

## Alert Types
[Sematext Cloud](http://sematext.com/cloud) includes multiple **types** of alerts that integrate with PagerDuty, Slack, email, and [other 3rd party services](#notifications-tab).  

1. **Threshold** alerts are the classic threshold based alerts. They are triggeed when a certain pre-defiend threshold is met.
1. **Anomaly** alerts are based on statistical anomaly detection. They are triggeed when values suddenly change and deviate from the continously computed baseline.
1. **Heartbeat** alerts are triggered when [Sematext Cloud](http://sematext.com/cloud) stops receiving data from your server, container, application, etc.

## Alert Sources
Alerts can operate on three different **sources** of data:  

1. **Metrics** alerts work with infrastructure metrics
1. **Logs** alerts are based on various types of logs
1. **Experience** alerts are concerned with *real user monitoring* data - RUM

Alert type | Metrics | Logs | Experience
--- | --- | --- | ---
Threshold | yes | yes | yes
Anomaly | yes | yes | yes
Heartbeat | yes | no | no

You can manage Alert rules interactively via the UI, or you can [manage alerts via the API](../api).
