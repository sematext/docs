title: Sematext App - Logs
description: Sematext App is a modern monitoring, log management, transaction tracing, and real user monitoring system that aggregates and structures your logs across various languages and platforms. It is a suite of products that combine high-quality logging experience with other monitoring and alerting devops tools helping fix production issues

[Sematext logging platform](https://sematext.com/logsene/) provides both ability to create your own queries through its [Elasticsearch API](https://sematext.com/docs/logs/search-through-the-elasticsearch-api/) as well as rich, yet simple query syntax very much like the [query syntax](https://sematext.com/docs/logs/search-syntax/) used by Google. 

We also have a [command line tool](https://sematext.com/blog/logsene-cli/) used for viewing, searching, filtering, and analyzing of log entries across all your logs from all your apps. 

Logs are aggregated by time and shown in the logging management web application, where you have the ability to search for specific terms, narrow down time ranges, filter fields, setup alerts and more. The supported Search API's are URI based search, Request body based search, Real time GET operation, and Multiple GET and Multiple Search operations in a single request.
