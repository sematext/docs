## Color Usage
In Sematext, the effective use of colors is essential for conveying data insights clearly. 
<br/>Here are some best practices to follow when using colors in your charts:

### Purposeful Color Application

Colors should have a clear and meaningful purpose in your charts. 
<br/>Consider what each color represents and how it aids in user understanding. 
<br/>Avoid using colors indiscriminately or for purely decorative purposes.

### Neutral

| Examples  |  | Elements |
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| ![Neutral Colors](../images/dashboards/color-guide/color-example-neutral.png) | **When to Use:** Neutral grey is primarily used for non-essential or neutral elements in your charts. It helps create a visual hierarchy by distinguishing between critical and less important information. <br/> <br/> **Examples of Use:** You can use grey for background elements, gridlines, or non-essential labels. It can also be used for secondary data or data that is less important in a specific context.  | ![Neutral Color Elements](../images/dashboards/color-guide/color-example-neutral-elements.png)  |

#### Informational

| Examples  |  | Elements |
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| ![Informational Colors](../images/dashboards/color-guide/color-example-info.png) | **When to Use:** Blue is employed to convey general or informational content. It is suitable for data that does not require immediate attention but provides context or supplementary details. <br/> <br/> **Examples of Use:** se blue for labeling axes, legends, tooltips, or annotations. It can also represent data points that are informational rather than alerting.  | ![Informational Color Elements](../images/dashboards/color-guide/color-example-info-elements.png)  |

### Color for Highlighting

Use colors to highlight specific data points, trends, or anomalies. <br/> 
Highlighting can draw attention to critical information, making it easier for users to identify key insights at a glance.

### Color Consistency

Maintain consistency in your color usage throughout the app.  <br/> 
For example, if you use green to represent success in one chart, continue using green consistently for success in other charts and visualizations.
