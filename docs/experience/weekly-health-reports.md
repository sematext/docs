title: Weekly Health Reports
description: Sematext Experience weekly health reports are automatic emails sent each week to provide a snapshot of your website's performance metrics and user interactions.

Weekly Health reports are automatically sent on Monday and provide a snapshot of your website’s performance and user interactions over the past week. The email compiles different metrics compared to the previous week and the last four weeks, giving you a quick glance at the information and helping you decide if further investigation is necessary without opening Sematext Cloud.

## What's in the Weekly Health Report
