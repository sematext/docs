title: What is an App?
description: Sematext Cloud Apps Guide. Using Apps to control access to metrics, logs, traces, etc. and managing costs.

Apps act as containers for your data. You can store performance
metrics or logs about servers, containers, software, programming
languages and databases. Our Apps have dozens of monitoring
integrations with software like Docker, AWS, Solr, Elasticsearch, [and
many more](https://sematext.com/docs/integration/), while our log
integration works with several different [log
shippers](https://sematext.com/docs/integration/#log-shippers). Every
App is isolated and standalone.

### Managing Access

Because Apps are standalone, they can be configured to give access to
certain roles. You can create custom access roles for different
members of your team. This also allows you to transfer the ownership
of an App to another member. All configurations and settings will be
kept after the transfer. Having role-based access control for every
single App in Sematext Cloud makes it easier for you to manage both
Apps and team members.

### Better Cost Management

Unlike virtually all other monitoring solutions, in Sematext Cloud you
do not have to pick a single plan for your whole account.  Instead,
pricing is defined per-App.  Thus, you can choose a different plan 
for different sets of metrics, logs, traces, etc.  With that you can
also pick different data retention.

This gives you, the user, more fine grained control over your costs,
as you can see on [the pricing page](https://sematext.com/pricing/).
