title: Apache Web Server Monitoring Integration
description: Apache monitoring integration sends workers, scoreboard, php fpm, and httpd server performance metrics and other inventory data from your OS and web server to Sematext in cloud SaaS / private on-premises infrastructure and application monitoring & log management service 

Sematext offers a simple, easy to install, Apache monitoring agent with minimal CPU and memory overhead.

## Install Apache Monitoring Agent

Setting up the monitoring agent takes less than 5 minutes:

1.  Activate Apache `mod_status` module with `sudo a2enmod status` and configure it in `status.conf` file, e.g. in `/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/status.conf`:

        ExtendedStatus On
        <Location /server-status>
          SetHandler server-status
        </Location>

2.  Create an Apache App in the  [Integrations / Overview](https://apps.sematext.com/ui/monitoring-create) (or  [Sematext Cloud Europe](https://apps.eu.sematext.com/ui/monitoring-create)). This will let you install the agent and control access to your monitoring and logs data. The short  [What is an App in Sematext Cloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr_qxdr8dvk&index=14&list=plt_fd32ofypflbfzz_hiafnqjdltth1ns) video has more details.
3.  Name your Apache monitoring App and, if you want to collect Apache logs as well, create a Logs App along the way.
4.  Install the Sematext Agent according to the [https://apps.sematext.com/ui/howto/Apache/overview](https://apps.sematext.com/ui/howto/Apache/overview) displayed in the UI.
