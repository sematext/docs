title: Docker Monitoring Integration
description: Container performance monitoring - metrics, event, log collection and parsing for Docker

The Sematext Integration for Docker uses [Sematext Agent](https://sematext.com/docs/containers/) and the open-source [Logagent](https://sematext.com/docs/logagent/installation-docker/) for the collection of container logs.

We at Sematext aim to save you time and effort by giving you a strong starting point for monitoring Docker. You will **not** have to:

- figure out which metrics to collect and which ones to ignore
- give metrics meaningful labels
- hunt for metric descriptions in the docs so that you know what each of them actually shows
- build charts to group metrics that you really want on the same charts, not N separate charts
- figure out, for each metric, which aggregation to use (min? max? avg? something else?)
- build dashboards to combine charts with metrics you typically want to see together
- set up basic alert rules

We set it up for you, out-of-the-box!

## Docker Monitoring with Sematext Agent

Sematext Agent collects various metrics about hosts and ships that to Sematext Cloud.

First create a [Docker Monitoring App in Sematext Cloud](https://apps.sematext.com/ui/monitoring-create).

### Docker
You install the Agent simply by running one Docker command. This will start the Agent as a Docker container on your host.

```bash
docker run -d  --restart always --privileged -P --name st-agent \
  -v /:/hostfs:ro \
  -v /sys/kernel/debug:/sys/kernel/debug \
  -v /var/run/:/var/run/ \
  -v /proc:/host/proc:ro \
  -v /etc:/host/etc:ro \
  -v /sys:/host/sys:ro \
  -v /usr/lib:/host/usr/lib:ro \
  -e CONTAINER_TOKEN=84fbc37e-a0fb-418c-9bcb-ea7c763dd9ac \
  -e INFRA_TOKEN=6377be8e-8441-46de-85dc-11ee3646c3de \
  -e REGION=US \
  -e JOURNAL_DIR=/var/run/st-agent \
  -e LOGGING_WRITE_EVENTS=false \
  -e LOGGING_REQUEST_TRACKING=false \
  -e LOGGING_LEVEL=info \
  -e NODE_NAME=`hostname` \
  -e CONTAINER_SKIP_BY_IMAGE=sematext \
  sematext/agent:latest
```

### Docker Compose
If you prefer adding the Agent in a `docker-compose` configuration, here's how you do it.

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: '3'
services:
  sematext-agent:
    image: 'sematext/agent:latest'
    environment:
      - affinity:container!=*sematext-agent*
      - CONTAINER_TOKEN=84fbc37e-a0fb-418c-9bcb-ea7c763dd9ac
      - INFRA_TOKEN=6377be8e-8441-46de-85dc-11ee3646c3de
      - REGION=US
      - JOURNAL_DIR=/var/run/st-agent
      - LOGGING_WRITE_EVENTS=false
      - LOGGING_REQUEST_TRACKING=false
      - LOGGING_LEVEL=info
      - NODE_NAME=$HOSTNAME
      - CONTAINER_SKIP_BY_IMAGE=sematext
    cap_add:
      - SYS_ADMIN
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - '/:/hostfs:ro'
      - '/var/run/:/var/run/'
      - '/sys/kernel/debug:/sys/kernel/debug'
      - '/proc:/host/proc:ro'
      - '/etc:/host/etc:ro'
      - '/sys:/host/sys:ro'
      - '/usr/lib:/host/usr/lib:ro'
```

Then you can run one command to start the Agent.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Docker Swarm

If you're running a Docker Swarm cluster, it's just as easy to run a Docker Swarm service.

```bash
docker service create --mode global --name st-agent \
  --restart-condition any \
  --mount type=bind,src=/,dst=/hostfs,readonly \
  --mount type=bind,src=/var/run,dst=/var/run/ \
  --mount type=bind,src=/usr/lib,dst=/host/usr/lib \
  --mount type=bind,src=/sys/kernel/debug,dst=/sys/kernel/debug \
  --mount type=bind,src=/proc,dst=/host/proc,readonly \
  --mount type=bind,src=/etc,dst=/host/etc,readonly \
  --mount type=bind,src=/sys,dst=/host/sys,readonly \
  -e NODE_NAME={{.Node.Hostname}} \
  -e CONTAINER_TOKEN=84fbc37e-a0fb-418c-9bcb-ea7c763dd9ac \
  -e INFRA_TOKEN=6377be8e-8441-46de-85dc-11ee3646c3de \
  -e REGION=US \
  -e JOURNAL_DIR=/var/run/st-agent \
  -e LOGGING_REQUEST_TRACKING=false \
  -e LOGGING_WRITE_EVENTS=false \
  -e LOGGING_LEVEL=info \
  -e PKG_ENABLED=false \
  sematext/agent:latest
```

If you like using `docker stack`, editing the `docker-compose.yml` from above slightly you'll have a working configuration.

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  agent:
    image: sematext/agent:latest
    deploy:
      mode: global
      labels: [APP=AGENT]
      restart_policy:
        condition: any
        delay: 1s
    cap_add:
      - SYS_ADMIN
    restart: always
    environment:
      - affinity:container!=*sematext-agent*
      - CONTAINER_TOKEN=84fbc37e-a0fb-418c-9bcb-ea7c763dd9ac
      - INFRA_TOKEN=6377be8e-8441-46de-85dc-11ee3646c3de
      - JOURNAL_DIR=/var/run/st-agent
      - LOGGING_WRITE_EVENTS=false
      - LOGGING_REQUEST_TRACKING=false
      - LOGGING_LEVEL=info
      - NODE_NAME=$HOSTNAME
      - CONTAINER_SKIP_BY_IMAGE=sematext
      - REGION=US
      - PKG_ENABLED=false
    volumes:
      - "/:/hostfs:ro"
      - "/var/run:/var/run/"
      - "/usr/lib:/host/usr/lib"
      - "/sys/kernel/debug:/sys/kernel/debug"
      - "/proc:/host/proc:ro"
      - "/etc:/host/etc:ro"
      - "/sys:/host/sys:ro"
```

Then you run:

```bash
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml <name>
```

The Sematext Agent will start collecting dozens of key metrics right away, and start showing you the performance and health of your Docker containers immediately.

## Collected Docker Metrics
The Sematext Agent will collect the following container and host metrics.

### Host Metrics

- CPU
- memory

![](../images/integrations/docker/hostcpu.png)

- disk

![](../images/integrations/docker/hostdisk.png)

- network
- processes
- containers

![](../images/integrations/docker/containers.png)

- orchestrator platforms

### eBPF Support

To gain deep **insight into the Linux kernel**, Sematext Agent relies on **eBPF** to implant **instrumentation points**, which means to **attach eBPF programs to kprobes** on kernel functions. This ensures a very efficient and powerful system exploration approach with better network tracing and negligible overhead.

### Service Auto-Discovery

Sematext Agent can **auto-discover services** deployed on physical/virtual hosts and containers. It also collects data about your infrastructure to provide you with infrastructure inventory reports. It collects events from different sources such as OOM notifications, container or Kubernetes events.

### Container Metrics

- Container runtime agnostic discovery and monitoring
    - Containers are discovered from cgroupfs hierarchies
    - Supports Docker and Rkt container engines
- Container metrics fetched directly from cgroupfs
    - CPU usage
    - Disk space usage and IO stats
        ![](../images/integrations/docker/container-cpu-io.png)
    - Memory usage, memory limits, and memory fail counters
    - Network IO stats
        ![](../images/integrations/docker/container-memory-network.png)
- Collection of host inventory information
    - Host kernel version/system information
    - Information about installed software packages
- Collection of container metadata
    - Container name
    - Image name
    - Container networks
    - Container volumes
    - Container environment
    - Container labels including relevant information about orchestration
    - Kubernetes metadata such as Pod name, UUID, Namespace
    - Docker Swarm metadata such as Service name, Swarm Task etc.
        ![](../images/integrations/docker/container-metadata.png)
- Collection of container events
- Docker events such as start/stop/die/volume mount, etc.
- Kubernetes events such as Pod status changes deployed, destroyed etc.
- Tracking deployment status and Pod restarts over time

That is a lot of information and **Sematext organizes this information in reports** for **infrastructure monitoring**, **container monitoring**, and **Kubernetes cluster monitoring**.

## Docker Alerting
To save you time Sematext automatically creates a set of default alert rules such as alerts for low disk space. You can [create additional alerts](../alerts) on any metric.

There are 3 types of alerts in Sematext:

- **Heartbeat alerts**, which notify you when a server is down
- **Threshold-based alerts** that notify you when a metric value crosses a predefined threshold
- **Alerts** based on statistical **anomaly detection** that notify you when metric values suddenly change and deviate from the baseline

![](https://sematext.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/docker-container-alerts.gif)

## Docker Events
Events reflect changes in your infrastructure, from node restarts to container deployments, or changes in running containers. Events can track every Docker command. **Sematext Agent collects Events from the Docker Engine and Kubernetes API.** Whenever something goes wrong in your container stack, you can **correlate Logs or Metrics with the time of Docker events!**

Here's the list of Docker container events Sematext collects:

### Container lifecycle events

- Create – when a container is created
- Start – when a container starts
- Restart – when a container gets restarted
- Stop – when a container stops
- Oom – when a container runs out of memory
- Pause – when a container gets paused
- Unpause – when a container continues to run after a pause
- Die – when the main process in a container dies
- Kill – when the container gets killed
- Destroy – when a container gets destroyed

### Container runtime events

- Commit – when changes to the container filesystem are committed. Modifying deployed containers in production is not a common practice, therefore the commit could - indicate a “hack” and should be watched carefully.
- Copy – when files are copied from/to a container. Could indicate a potential data leak.
- Attach – when a process connects to container console – somebody is reading your container logs
- Detach – when a process disconnects from container console streams
- Exec – when a command is executed in container console, very helpful to investigate in potential hacker attacks
- Export – when a container gets exported
- Health_status – when health_status is checked
- Rename – when a container gets renamed
- Resize – when a container gets resized
- Top – when somebody list top processes in a container
- Update – when a container is updated e.g. with new labels

### Container image events

- Delete – when an image gets deleted
- Import – when an image gets imported
- Load – when an image is loaded
- Pull – when an image is pulled from a registry
- Push – when an image is pushed to a registry
- Save – when an image is saved
- Tag – when an image is tagged with labels
- Untag – when an image tag is removed

### Container plugin events

- Enable – when a plugin gets enabled
- Disable – when a plugin gets disabled
- Install – when a plugin gets installed
- Remove – when a plugin gets removed

### Container volume events

- Create – when a volume is created
- Destroy – when a volume gets destroyed
- Mount – when a volume is mounted to a container
- Unmount – when a volume is removed from a container

### Container network events

- Create – when a  network is created
- Connect – when a container connects to a network
- Remove – when the network is removed
- Destroy – when a network is destroyed
- Disconnect – when a container disconnects from a network

### Docker daemon events

- Reload

### Docker services, nodes, secrets, and config events

- Create – on the creation of a resource
- Remove – on the removal of a resource
- Update – on the creation of a resource
