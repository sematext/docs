title: JVM Garbage Collector Logs Integration
description: Sematext JVM Garbage Collector Logs integration allows you to check garbage collector logs, times the application's threads were stopped, memory regions size, and much more.

The detailed explanation of JVM Monitoring and Logs integration can be found on the [JVM integration](https://sematext.com/docs/integration/jvm-integration/) page, where you can set up the shipping of both metrics and logs through a single installation.
