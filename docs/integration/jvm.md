title: JVM Monitoring Integration
description: Sematext Java application performance monitoring provides real time reports on JVM pool size, utilization and threads, garbage collectors, JVM open files, memory and resource usage, and more. Correlate them with other infrastructure metrics (server, virtualization, logs, etc.), and use proactive alerts and intuitive dashboards for rapid problem diagnosis at JVM level

The detailed explanation of JVM Monitoring and Logs integration can be found on the [JVM integration](https://sematext.com/docs/integration/jvm-integration/) page, where you can set up the shipping of both metrics and logs through a single installation.
