title: Nginx Monitoring Integration
description: The Sematext monitoring agent can collect many metrics from NGINX instances, including requests, reading, writing, waiting, active and more. Utilize built-in anomaly detection, threshold, and heartbeat alerting and send notifications to email and various chatops messaging services. Correlate events & logs, filter metrics by server or time, and visualize your cluster's health with out of the box graphs and custom dashboards

Sematext offers a simple, easy to install, Nginx monitoring agent with minimal CPU and memory overhead.

## Install Nginx Monitoring Agent

Setting up the monitoring agent takes less than 5 minutes:

1.  Activate the Nginx stub_status module in the server section of your Nginx config file. If you are using the default Nginx config file it will be in `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default`:

        location /nginx_status {
          stub_status on;
          access_log off;
        }

2.  Create an Nginx App in the  [Integrations / Overview](https://apps.sematext.com/ui/monitoring-create) (or  [Sematext Cloud Europe](https://apps.eu.sematext.com/ui/monitoring-create)). This will let you install the agent and control access to your monitoring and logs data. The short  [What is an App in Sematext Cloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tr_qxdr8dvk&index=14&list=plt_fd32ofypflbfzz_hiafnqjdltth1ns) video has more details.
3.  Name your Nginx monitoring App and, if you want to collect Nginx logs as well, create a Logs App along the way.
4.  Install the Sematext Agent according to the  [setup instructions](https://apps.sematext.com/ui/howto/Nginx/overview) displayed in the UI.
