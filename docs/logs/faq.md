title: Log Management FAQ
description:  Cloud based SaaS / On-premises logging as a service platform FAQ on log shipping, log events fields and count, data retention and daily volumes, Kibana and more 

## General

### How many logs can I store?

There is no limit to how many logs you can store in your logging management app.
 That said, you should try to pick the ideal Daily Volume when picking
your plan, as that is going to give you the most optimal $/GB
price.

If you pick too small Daily Volume and often go over the
selected volume your $/GB price will be higher than if you picked the
next higher Daily Volume.

### How many fields can my log events have?

A single Logs App allows up to 1000 fields.  Most of the time you will want to pay attention to how you
structure your logs in order to get the most value out of them, and
that typically includes having a manageable number of fields in your
logs.

### We are getting "Too many fields present in the index". What does that mean and how can we fix it?

This means you have more than the allowed number of distinct fields in your Logs App.  To manually remove some fields use the Field Editor, but if you continue shipping logs with fields you've removed via Field Editor those fields will be recreated.

Some reasons why this may happen and how to address it:
* You have a high number of different types of log events with different sets of fields, maybe from different sources.  You may want to [consider using multiple Logs Apps](https://sematext.com/docs/logs/faq/#i-have-multiple-log-sources-should-i-send-them-all-to-the-same-logs-app) in such cases.  You can [ship logs from different sources to different Logs Apps](https://sematext.com/docs/logagent/faq/#how-do-i-ship-logs-to-multiple-destinations-sematext-logs-apps), [ship logs to different Logs Apps based on the matching patterns](https://sematext.com/docs/logagent/faq/#how-do-i-ship-logs-that-match-different-patterns-to-different-destinations-sematext-logs-apps)), or use [grep plugin](/logagent/input-filter-grep/) to [drop logs that match a certain pattern](https://sematext.com/docs/logagent/faq/#how-do-i-drop-logs-that-match-a-certain-pattern).
* You have many different deeply nested fields (e.g. foo.bar.bar, foo.bar.bam, etc.), perhaps because you log "objects" with attributes.  Often times you don't want all attributes to turn into individual fields.  If you are using [Logagent](/logagent) you can use REMOVE_FIELDs or [remove-fields output filter](/logagent/output-filter-removefields/) to remove fields.

### What is @timestamp field?

`@timestamp` is a date field that is used to filter logs by a selected time. If a log event does not have such a field defined,
we will add it and set it to the time when we first receieved the log event.

### How can I check how many GB/day I am shipping to your centralized logging management solution?

From the application, click the `App Actions` button and select
`Usage`. There's also `Settings` button next to [any of your Logs apps](https://apps.sematext.com/ui/logs) in
the `Logs > All Logs Apps` section in our centralized logging and monitoring management solution.

<a href="#logging-usage-menu"><img alt="Logs App Usage Menu" src="/docs/images/logs/logging-usage-menu.png" title="Logs App Usage Menu"></a>

On click, `App Settings > Usage` page will present both Total Volume in Gb and Total Count of indexed logs for that particular Logs App.

<img alt="Logs App Log Count" src="/docs/images/logs/logging-app-usage-page.png" title="Logs App usage page">

### How can I check the number of logs I currently have in a Logs App?

Total Count of indexed logs is displayed in `App Settings > Usage` page.

The number of logs will be also displayed in the right corner of the Log Counts panel just below the app's search input. It will change as you perform search queries, change time and apply filters in your Logs App.

<img alt="Logs App Log Count" src="/docs/images/logs/logging-app-logs-count.png" title="Logs App Log Count">

You can also do that from Kibana
by searching for all your logs without adding any time filters. The
number of hits represents the number of all your logs.

### How long are my logs stored?

How long your logs are stored depends on what Data Retention you
selected when you picked your Logging Management App plan.  Each such app can have a
different Daily Retention, Daily Volume, and plan.  You can change
retention, volume, and plan at any time.

Click the `App Actions` button and select `App Settings`. App Info page will open where you can see and change Daily Retention, Daily Volume, and Plan for that particular Logs App.

<img alt="Logs App Daily Retention, Daily Volume, and Plan Info" src="/docs/images/logs/logging-app-settings.png" title="Logs App Daily Retention, Daily Volume, and Plan Info ">

### Can I send old logs?

Yes, you can send all logs. However, keep in mind your Logs App's
Data Retention settings.  For example, if your retention is set to 7
days and you send logs that are 10 days old, we will give you a warning 
saying that you are outside of your valid retention time range.

### How can I send old logs?

Use [Logagent](/logagent).  With Logagent you can then do: ```cat
/path/to/old/log | logagent -t YOUR_LOGSENE_APP_TOKEN```

### What is data retention and how does it work?

Data retention mechanism is responsible for removing old log events.
If you have retention set to 7 days, all log events that are received more than 7 days ago will be removed. 
For paid plans we remove whole 24-hour periods once a day. For free plans we
remove old data every 30 minutes.

### Is data retention based on index/import/upload/receive time or the actual log event @timestamp?

Data retention is based on log events' receive timestamp.

### Are logs shipped to Logs App ever rejected?

When you pick a Daily Volume we automatically set another logging system
property called *Max* Daily Volume.  By default we set it to 2x the
selected Daily Volume.  When this limit is hit, our centralized logging management solution will stop
accepting new logs for that Logs App until the next day (00:00 UTC).
 This Max Daily Volume is adjustable, so you can set it to whichever
value you'd like.

This Max Daily Volume limit prevents run-away logging
from causing over-billing. Logs App will send email notifications before
this limit is reached.

### What is the maximum log size Logs App will accept?

That depends on the plan you selected for your application. If your
application is using the *Basic* plan, our logging management platform will accept logs up to 64
KB in size. If your application is using the *Standard* plan, it
will allow logs up to 128 KB. If your application is using the *Pro*
plan, it will accept logs up to 256 KB in size. If your logs are
larger than the mentioned limits, please consider using the *Enterprise*
plan.

### My logs have special structure.  Can Logs App handle that?

Yes, if the default log index fields (also known as index mapping)
don't fit your needs you can create completely custom index mapping.
See [Custom Mapping Template How-To](https://sematext.com/blog/custom-elasticsearch-index-templates-in-logsene/).


### I have multiple log sources - should I send them all to the same Logs App?

Sending logs from multiple log sources to the same Logs App is not
a problem at all.  However, if you have multiple different log
structures (different "fields" in the logs), see the next FAQ
entry.

<a name="i-have-multiple-different-log-structures-each-with-a-different-set-of-fields-how-should-i-handle-that"></a>

### I have multiple different log structures, each with a different set of fields.  How should I handle that?

If you have N different log structures, the best way to handle that
is by creating N Logs Apps, each with its own index mapping.  For
example, you may have web server logs, your system logs in
/var/log/messages, and your custom application logs.  Each of these 3
types of logs has a different structure.

The web server logs probably
use Apache Common Log format, the logs in /var/log/messages have syslog
structure, and your own application's logs can be in any format your
application happens to use.  To handle all 3 log formats elegantly
simply create 3 separate Logs Apps and use a different format for
each of them.

If you want to be able to search all logs together, even
when they have different fields, you can do that - just ship them all to
the same Logs App.  The thing to watch out for are fields that have
the same name, but different data type.  For example, if one log source
has a purely numeric field "size" and another log source also has a
field "size", but can have non-numeric values, this will cause issues.

Thus, either keep logs of different structures in separate logging
app or make sure there are no conflicting fields.

### My data structure changed, can I reindex my data automatically?

Yes, when you change your index structure using Field Editor you will
be given the opportunity to reindex your data.

<img alt="Logs App Log Count" src="/docs/images/logs/reindex-field-editor.png" title="Reindex your data using Field Editor">
          
Please keep in mind that the speed of reindexing depends on how much
data needs to be reindexed and that reindexing is treated like original
ingestion, which means it counts towards your daily volume and could
result in you hitting your Max Daily Volume Limit.

### Is automatic reindex free?

Using Sematext's Logs App reindex functionality is available for all plans and
the normal plan charges apply. Because reindexing counts just like
the original data ingestion, before reindexing the estimated cost of
reindexing is shown in the UI.

![](attachments/6520901/102003301.png?width=300)

If the amount of data ingested for the day, plus data to be reindexed
is smaller than your Max Daily Log Volume Limit then no additional charges
will be applied.

## Log Shipping

### Which log shippers, logging libraries, and platform integrations are supported?

You can use [numerous log shippers, logging libraries, and platform integrations](/integration/#logging).

### How can I import logs from my existing Elasticsearch / ELK / Elastic stack?

You can use Logstash to copy logs from your own ELK / Elastic Stack to our Logs App as described at [Elastic Stack Import-Export with Logstash & Logsene](https://sematext.com/blog/logstash-migrating-data-logsene/).

### How can I ship logs from Android and iOS apps?

For shipping logs from Android apps use
<https://github.com/sematext/sematext-logsene-android> and for
shipping logs from iOS apps use
<https://github.com/sematext/sematext-logsene-ios>.

### How can I ship AWS CloudTrail logs, AWS VPC logs, and other logs from S3?

Use the
<https://github.com/sematext/logsene-aws-lambda-cloudwatch> AWS Lambda
function. See [Forwarding CloudTrail or Other Logs from AWS S3 to Logsene](https://sematext.com/blog/forwarding-cloudtrail-or-other-logs-from-aws-s3-to-logsene/)
and [Sending AWS Cloudwatch Logs to Logsene](https://sematext.com/blog/sending-aws-cloudwatchvpc-logs-to-logsene/)
for detailed description of how to do
this.

### Why is it that I can forward logs with rsyslog via TCP or UDP, but not via RELP?

You probably need to install the [omrelp module](http://www.rsyslog.com/doc/omrelp.html) first. If you have
rsyslog installed in your system, there's probably a package that you
can install:

For RedHat and CentOS:

``` bash
% yum install rsyslog-relp
```

For Debian and Ubuntu:

``` bash
% apt-get install rsyslog-relp
```

For SUSE and OpenSUSE:

``` bash
% zypper install rsyslog-module-relp
```

If you compiled rsyslog manually, you need to supply `--enable-relp`
to the configure script. You can check if rsyslog starts properly by
starting it in foreground:

``` bash
% rsyslogd -n
```

You will get an error if the module is not found or you have any other
problem. For debug mode, add `-d` as
well.

### How do I ship exception stack traces and other multi-line logs with Logstash without breaking them into multiple log events?

Please see [Handling Stack Traces with Logstash](https://sematext.com/blog/handling-stack-traces-with-logstash/).

## Plans & Prices

### How much does your centralized logging management solution cost?

Check the [Logs App Plans & Prices](https://www.sematext.com/logsene/pricing).

### What happens with my logs when I change from the free to a paid plan or vice versa?

You don't have to worry about your data when you switch from the free
plan to a paid one. Your logs will remain safe and you can still be able
to search them. Your data will remain accessible based on your data
retention settings.  However, when you move from a paid plan to a free
plan, free plan restrictions will be applied to your data, which
including data retention, too.

### What happens if I go over the selected daily log volume and how much does that cost?

The GB/day volume is **not** a limit. That number controls only *cost
per GB*. When you go over the GB/day number you had selected we do not
reject your data (for protection, use Max Daily Volume). Instead, we
keep track of how much data over the selected daily volume was shipped
and add that to the monthly cost using the $/GB rate for the selected
daily volume.

The higher daily volume you select, the lower the per GB
price.  For example, if you picked 1 GB/day and you typically don't go
over it, or go over very little, then it pays to keep that 1 GB/day
selection.  However, if you ship closer to 5 GB/day, then you should
select 5 GB/day volume, because that will give you a lower $/GB rate
than if you stay with 1 GB/day selection.

### How much data can I ship to Sematext using the Basic plan?

Each day, a total of 500 MB/day can be shipped to all Sematext Logs Apps together.
To ship more data use one of the bigger plans.

## Troubleshooting

### Why am I not seeing my logs?

The most common reason is that logs' timestamps are in the future,
and this most often happens when timestamps don't specify the timezone.
 For example, if you are east of UTC (e.g. in +0100 – 1 hour ahead of
UTC) and you send logs with timestamps in your local time, but without
specifying your local timezone, like this: 2016-01-30T14:00:00.000Z –
this timestamp actually represents 14:00 in UTC.  However, if it 14:00
in your timezone, which is 1 hour ahead of UTC, that means that 14:00
UTC is actually 1 hours in the future.

Currently, our Logs App does not display logs that have timestamps in
the future, but it does accept them, and shows them when those
timestamps stop being in the future.

Another possibility why you are not seeing your logs is that their
structure clashes with the structure of your existing logs in the same
Logs App.  For example, if you have sent logs with field "priority"
as integer field then Sematext's Logging Platform will expect all future values of
"priority" field to be integers.

Sending a string value in a "priority"
field will fail.  Note that you *can* change the underlying field
"mapping" at any time - see elsewhere in this FAQ.

If none of the above turns out to be a problem in your case, please let
us know via <support@sematext.com> or via our live chat!

### How to check if there are any network connectivity issues?

Things to check to ensure network connectivity is OK:

1. Try to connect to logsene-receiver.sematext.com / logsene-receiver.eu.sematext.com (port 80 or 443)
with the following command:

``` bash
nc -zv -w 20 logsene-receiver.sematext.com 443
```

or if you are using syslog, connect to
logsene-syslog-receiver.sematext.com / logsene-syslog-receiver.eu.sematext.com (port 514 for TCP and UDP, port
20514 for RELP, port 10514 for TLS):

``` bash
nc -zv -w 20 logsene-syslog-receiver.sematext.com 10514
```

The output should show something like: Connection to
logsene-receiver.sematext.com 443
port \[tcp/https\] succeeded!

In case you see some other result:

  - if your server requires proxy to access the Internet, you'll have to
    adjust your log shipper config to use proxy settings
  - if firewall is used to protect your server, it may be blocking
    outbound traffic from it. Depending on which receiver and protocol
    you are using, please ensure with your IT/network admins that right
    ports are open for outbound traffic
  - check your DNS (see below)

2. Check if your DNS has correct entries for Logs App Receiver:

``` bash
nslookup logsene-receiver.sematext.com
nslookup logsene-receiver.eu.sematext.com
```

The output of these commands should look like this, although the IP
addresses and names may be somewhat different, as they change
periodically:

``` bash
Server:        127.0.1.1
Address:    127.0.1.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
logsene-receiver.sematext.com    canonical name = VPC-Logsene-Token-Receiver-LB-188765535.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com.
Name:    VPC-Logsene-Token-Receiver-LB-188765535.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
Address: 52.54.165.65
Name:    VPC-Logsene-Token-Receiver-LB-188765535.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
Address: 34.196.180.172
```

Or, if you are using syslog, try:

``` bash
nslookup logsene-syslog-receiver.sematext.com
nslookup logsene-syslog-receiver.eu.sematext.com
```

The output should be similar to:

``` bash
Server:        127.0.1.1
Address:    127.0.1.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
logsene-syslog-receiver.sematext.com    canonical name = ec2-52-44-248-43.compute-1.amazonaws.com.
Name:    ec2-52-44-248-43.compute-1.amazonaws.com
Address: 52.44.248.43
```

<a name="how-to-avoid-failed-events"></a>

### How to avoid 'failed events'?

Sematext Cloud is a schema-less storage and uses Elasticsearch as log storage. 
When your App receives new log lines, containing unknown fields, those fields are automatically created with the data type of the field value (string, number, object). 
So you don't need to specify a schema (called 'mapping' in Elasticsearch) upfront. 
When you ship logs (Elasticsearch document) with the same field name and different types (string, number, object) an error called `mapper_parsing_exception` happens in Elasticsearch. This means the document can't be indexed because of a mismatch in the data schema. 
Sematext Cloud catches this error and produces a `failed event` entry in your Logs App. 
The `failed event` entry contains the error message and the original document as JSON string in the field `logsene_orig_log`. 

You can resolve the problem with the `mapper_parsing_exception` with the following procedure: 
1) Check the `logsene_error` message, it contains details which field caused the conflict
2) Make sure that the fields use only one type (not a mix of string, number, object ...)

You could do three different things to avoid schema conflicts:
1) Adjust your log output to match the schema. E.g. rename the fields in your logs. 
2) Ship logs with different schema to different Sematext Cloud Log Apps. 

__Example:__ 

Service A produces a log with a field "detail" with a text message. 

```
{"detail": "Some error details here ..."}
```
Service B produces a log with a field "detail" with a JSON object 

```
{"detail": {"code": -1, "error":  "Some Error message here", "module": "mycode"}
```
What could be done in this situation?  There are basically two options:

1) You could rename the field in the log output of in "Service B" e.g. `detail -> detail_object`.

```
{"detail_object": {"code": -1, "error":  "Some Error message here", "module": "myapp"}
```

The renaming could take place in your apps logging code, or in a log shipper configuration. Some log shippers have support to rename fields before logs get shipped.  

3) You could ship the logs of "Service B" to a separate Logs App (different App token).  Create a new Logs App in Sematext UI and configure your log shipper to ship logs from "Service B" to the new Logs App. 

Option #2 is probably the simplest way to resolve the issue. 

In case you created only one time logs with a wrong structure, you could use the Field Editor to change the schmema/mapping. Please refer to related FAQ section: [I have multiple different log structures, each with a different set of fields.  How should I handle that](#i-have-multiple-different-log-structures-each-with-a-different-set-of-fields-how-should-i-handle-that)

## Security

### Can I ship data to your centralized logging management solution using a secure and encrypted transport like TLS/SSL or HTTPS?

Yes, all data can be shipped both over encrypted channels like
TLS/SSL and HTTPS, or via their unencrypted counter-parts.
 See <https://apps.sematext.com/ui/logs> for more
information about how to configure log shipping.

### How secure is my data?

Our Logging Management Platform runs on Amazon AWS, whose infrastructure follows IT security
best practices and adheres to a number of compliance standards such
as SOC 1/SSAE, SOC 2, SOC 3,16/ISAE 3402 (formerly SAS 70 Type II),
FISMA, DIACAP, FedRAMP, and HIPAA.  For more information about AWS
security and compliance certifications see:
<http://aws.amazon.com/security> and <https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/>.

Your data is protected from unauthorized reads. If you want to read data using scripts you can authorize
your API calls using `apiKey`. You can read more about this [here](search-through-the-elasticsearch-api) and [here](/api).

### Where is my data stored?

Logs App runs and stores data in Amazon AWS in the US and the EU.  You can choose if you want your account and your data in the US or in the EU.

### How long is my data stored?

This depends on the data retention you selected for each of your logging
apps.  Backups are stored in S3 and kept for 90 days.

## Kibana

### Can I use my own Kibana?

Yes.

### How can I get a nice map of the world in Kibana?

Ensure you have a country field in your logs.  If you only have IP you
can use Logstash [geoip filter](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-filters-geoip.html). For example, a
configuration like this:

``` bash
input {
  stdin {
    type => "human"
  }
}
filter {
  geoip {
    source => "message"
  }
}
output {
  elasticsearch_http {
          host => "logsene-receiver.sematext.com"
          port => 80
          index => "YOUR-APPLICATION-TOKEN-GOES-HERE"
  }
}
```

If you then start Logstash and type in an IP, you'll see in Kibana an
object called **geoip**, which contains lots of information, including
country codes. You can then use `geoip.country_code2` as your field in
Kibana.

### Why are new fields not visible in Kibana and how do I fix it?

Kibana doesn't update field lists automatically. This problem is not
specific to our Logs App, but is a general Kibana issue. If you add new
fields to an index you must refresh the fields in Kibana. New fields
will appear and will be ready to use in your visualizations and
searches.

### How do I create a dashboard in Kibana?

Kibana requires the following high level steps to create a dashboard:

1.  Create a visualization - click to 'Visualize' and save it when
    finished. See
    also: <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/visualize.html>
2.  Create a "Search" in the Discover view and save it.  Once you do
    that you can add it as table to your Dashboard later (See screenshot
    "Log View").  See
    also: <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/discover.html>
3.  Go to the Dashboard view and add the saved visualizations to it.
     See
    also: <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/dashboard.html>
4.  Save the Dashboard

### Why can't I draw charts (dashboards) using a given field?

By default all string values sent to Logs App are analyzed. For each
analyzed fields we also create .raw field which is not analyzed. If you
want to use string field for drawing charts you should either use .raw
field or change index templates to use not_analyzed type
(<https://sematext.com/blog/custom-elasticsearch-index-templates-in-logsene/>).
 Let's consider an example. We have a field called 'title'. Our logging management solution
uses this field as analyzed one so it is not possible to use it in
dashboards. It also creates automatically a field called
'title.raw' and this one can be used for charts.

## Timestamps

### Why does my syslog timestamp have a different time zone?

The [original syslog specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3164) (RFC 3164) has a date
field that doesn't contain any time zone information. Fortunately,
there's a [new specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424) (RFC
5424) that uses [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)
timestamp. That's why we recommend using the new format for syslog
daemons that support it, such as [rsyslog](rsyslog) or
[syslog-ng](syslog-ng). If you use an older
[syslogd](syslogd) implementation, or you simply prefer to
use the older format, you have two options to have a correct timestamp:

  - set the system time on your server to UTC, or
  - change the timestamp for your logs to ISO 8601. For example, rsyslog
    does it with the default
    [template](http://www.rsyslog.com/doc/rsyslog_conf_templates.html)
    RSYSLOG_ForwardFormat. For instance, to forward all logs via TCP,
    with the original specification, but with the ISO timestamp, you'd
    add the following line to your config:

    *.* @@logsene-syslog-receiver.sematext.com:514;RSYSLOG_ForwardFormat

### What are the supported timestamp formats?

If you send your logs via the [Elasticsearch API](index-events-via-elasticsearch-api), you can use:

  - **ISO8601**. For example, **2001-06-08T08:00:01.123Z** or
    **2001-06-08T08:00:01+03:00**. A timezone must be there after the
    time (use **Z** for UTC), so *2001-06-08T08:00:01.123* won't work.
    You can also send timestamps with just the date (**2001-06-08**),
    and we'll count them as occurring at 00:00
  - **UNIX time in milliseconds**, for example **1487854172123**. UTC is
    assumed here, so we recommend setting the system time to UTC if you
    go this route

If you send your logs via syslog, you can use **ISO8601**, too
(recommended, see the previous question) or the legacy **RFC-3164
timestamp** (like **Oct 11 22:14:15**). The legacy format assumes UTC
and assumes the current year. It doesn't have sub-second precision,
either.

See [Supported Date Formats](supported-date-formats) for
more examples of supported date and time
formats.

### What happens if I try to send data with @timestamp older than my retention time?

You can send old logs because our data retention works by checking the received timestamp, not @timestamp.
For example, if your retention is set to 7 days and you send logs that are 10 days old (i.e. they contain a timestamp from
10 days ago), they will get accepted and processed, but when you set a time range to select those logs,
you might get warning that you selected time range that is outside of your retention.

### What happens if I try to send data with @timestamp that is in the future?

You can send logs with timestamps in the future, but they will not be
shown in Logs App until their timestamps stops being in the future.  For
example, if you send logs that are "2 hours ahead of real time" they
will be accepted, but will not be displayed until 2 hours
later.

## Alerts

### What are Logs App Alerts?

Logs App alerts are based on saved searches that trigger alert
notifications when these saved searches meet a certain threshold
condition in your logs - e.g. less than N matches in 5 minutes, more
than M matches in 3 minutes, etc., or when such saved searches detect
*sudden changes* in the number/volume of matching logs - i.e.,
anomalies.

### How to create Alerts in Logs App?

Alerts are added by clicking Save Query icon located next to the Logs App input field. Enter query info and select option to enable alerts. Alerts panel will expand and allow you to customize alert specific to that particular search query.

<img alt="Save Alert in Logs App" src="/docs/images/logs/save-alert-in-logging-app.gif" title="Save Alert in Logs App">

### How to view Alerts?

Click on Saved Queries Icon located next to the app's search input field.

### What is the difference between threshold-based Alerts and Anomaly Detection (aka Algolerts)?

If you have a clear idea about how many logs should be matching a
given Alert Query, then simply use threshold-based Alerts. In other
words, if you know that you always have some ERROR-level log events, you
may want to use threshold-based alerts for that.

For example, if your logs typically have < 100 ERROR-level messages per minute you may want
to create an Alert Query that matches ERROR log events and notifies you
when there are more than 100 such matches in 1 minute.

If you do not have a sense of how many matches a given Alert Query
matches on a regular bases, but you want to watch out for sudden changes
in volume, whether dips or spikes, use Algolerts (Anomaly
Detection-based Alerts).

An extreme example that you may actually like
is an Alert Query that matches all logs - "\*" - a single wildcard
character for a query. If you use that for an Algolert then Logs App will
notify you when the overall volume of your logs suddenly changes, which
may be a signal that you should look for what suddenly increased logging
(e.g. maybe something started logging lots of errors, exceptions,
timeouts, or some such), or why logging volume suddenly dropped (e.g.
maybe some of your server(s) or app(s) stopped working and sending
logs).

### Can I send Alerts to Slack, PagerDuty, Nagios, or other WebHooks and ChatOps services?

Yes. Our centralized logging management solution lets one configure arbitrary WebHooks to call with Alert
event information when Alert events are triggered. See [alerts FAQ](/faq#alerts) for more info.
