## Logsene

[Logsene](http://sematext.com/logsene)  is a centralized log management
solution where you can upload your logs in bulk or real-time from all
your servers.

Those logs are then aggregated by time and shown in the Logsene web
application, where you have the ability to search for specific terms,
narrow down time ranges, filter fields, setup alerts and more.

A quick rundown of most notable features of Logsene:

  - All your logs accessible in one place
  - Control who sees which data
  - Be up and running within minutes -- there is nothing to install or
    maintain
  - Log Alerts & Anomaly Detection
  - Saved Views
  - Scheduled Reporting
  - CoreOS Log Collection
  - Docker container monitoring
  - REST API

## Logsene CLI

Logsene CLI gives you capability to search through your logs from the
command-line, which brings the awesome benefit of being able to pipe
results to `awk`, `sed`, `cut`, `sort`, `head` and friends from the
\*nix command-line.

Imagine a situation where you suspected that your site were under a DoS
attack.

You'd be interested in quickly finding out the top offenders. Here’s a
one-liner that shows top originating IP addresses in the last 3 hours
(also shows how to use the `-f` switch to specify which field(s) to
return - field `host`, in this example):

``` bash
$ logsene search -t 3h -f host | sort | uniq -c | sort -r | head
-n20
```

You can find more useful examples in  [the blog post](http://blog.sematext.com/2015/07/07/logsene-cli/)  that announced
the release of Logsene CLI.

### Logsene CLI Session

We define L-CLI session as a set of commands issued by the user, with no
more than 30m between them. Every session has a set of configuration
parameters that control the way L-CLI behaves. E.g. which Sematext
account is used (`--api-key`); which Logsene application is used
(`--app-key`); is tracing information going to be displayed (--trace).

For controlling those settings, we use `config set` and `config
get` commands. For convenience reasons, you don't have to deal with API
and APP keys manually. L-CLI automatically retrieves both keys on each
session start, as users login (`--api-key`) and choose Logsene
application (`--app-key`). L-CLI then writes those parameters to the
session configuration store and reuses them on each subsequent command,
until the session times
out.

The session primitives were introduced in order to enable frictionless
multi-user experience, where all users may possibly be accessing L-CLI
from the same box (while being SSHd into it), using the same Sematext
account and possibly even the same Logsene application.



## Commands

###  **`logsene search`**

``` bash
Usage: logsene search [query] [OPTIONS]
  where OPTIONS may be:
    -q <query>      Query string (-q parameter can be omitted)
    -f <fields>     OPTIONAL Fields to return (defaults to all fields)
    -t <interval>   OPTIONAL datetime, duration or range (defaults to last hour)
    -s <size>       OPTIONAL Number of matches to return (d)efaults to 200)
    -o <offset>     OPTIONAL Number of matches to skip from the beginning (defaults to 0)
    -op AND         OPTIONAL Overrides default OR operator between multiple query terms
    --json          OPTIONAL Returns log entries in JSON instead of TSV format
    --sep           OPTIONAL Sets the separator between start and end of time ranges

Examples:
  logsene search
      returns last 1h of log entries
      note: default return limit of 200 hits is always in effect unless you
            explicitly change it with the -s switch (where -s without params
            disables the limit altogether)

  logsene search -q ERROR
      returns last 1h of log entries that contain the term ERROR

  logsene search ERROR
      equivalent to the previous example

  logsene search UNDEFINED SEGFAULT
      returns last 1h of log entries that have either of the terms
      note: default operator is OR

  logsene search SEGFAULT Segmentation -op AND
      returns last 1h of log entries that have both terms
      note: convenience parameter --and has the same effect

  logsene search -q "Server not responding"
      returns last 1h of log entries that contain the given phrase

  logsene search "rare thing" -t 1y8M4d8h30m2s
      returns all the log entries that contain the phrase "rare thing" reaching
      back to 1 year 8 months 4 days 8 hours 30 minutes and 2 seconds
      note: when specifying duration, any datetime designator character can be
            omited (shown in the following two examples)
      note: months must be specified with uppercase M (distinction from minutes)
      note: minutes (m) are the default, so "m" can be omited

  logsene search -t 1h30m
      returns all the log entries from the last 1,5h

  logsene search -t 90
      equivalent to the previous example (default time unit is minute)

  logsene search -t 2015-06-20T20:48
      returns all the log entries that were logged after the provided datetime
      note: allowed formats listed at the bottom of this help message

  logsene search -t "2015-06-20 20:28"
      returns all the log entries that were logged after the provided datetime
      note: if a parameter contains spaces, it must be enclosed in quotes

  logsene search -t 2015-06-16T22:27:41/2015-06-18T22:27:41
      returns all the log entries between the two provided timestamps
      note: date range must either contain forward slash between datetimes,
            or a different range separator must be specified (next example)

  logsene search -t "2015-06-16T22:27:41 TO 2015-06-18T22:27:41" --sep " TO "
      same as previous command, except it sets the custom string separator that
      denotes a range
      note: default separator is the forward slash (as per ISO-8601)
      note: if a parameter contains spaces, it must be enclosed in quotes

  logsene search -t "last Friday at 13/last Friday at 13:30"
      it is also possible to use "human language" to designate datetime
      note: it may be used only in place of datetime. Expressing range is not
            possible (e.g. "last friday between 12 and 14" is not allowed)
      note: may yield unpredictable datetime values

  logsene search -q ERROR -s 20
      returns at most 20 log entries (within the last hour) with the term ERROR

  logsene search ERROR -s 50 -o 20
      returns chronologically sorted hits 21st to 71st (offset is 20)
      note: default sort order is ascending (latest entries at the bottom)

  logsene search --help
      outputs this usage information

Allowed datetime formats:
  YYYY[-]MM[-]DD(T, )[HH[:MM[:SS]]]
  e.g.
    YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss
    YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm
    YYYY-MM-DDHH:mm
    YYYYMMDDTHH:mm
    YYYYMMDD HH:mm
    YYYY-MM-DD
    YYYYMMDD
    YYYY-MM-DD HHmm
    YYYYMMDD HHmm
    YYYY-MM-DDTHHmm
    YYYYMMDDTHH:mm
    YYYYMMDDTHHmm
    YYYYMMDDTHH:mm
    YYYY-MM-DDTHHmmss
    YYYYMMDDHHmmss
  note: date part may be separated from time by T (ISO-8601) or space
  note: if datetime contains a space, it must be enclosed in double quotes

Allowed duration format:
  [Ny][NM][Nd][Nh][Nm][Ns]
  e.g.
    1y2M8d22h8m48s
  note: uppercase M must be used for months, lowercase m for minutes
  note: if only a number is specified, it defaults to minutes

Allowed range formats
  range can be expressed in all datetime/duration combinations:
  datetime/datetime
  datetime/(+|-)duration
  duration/(+|-)duration
  duration/datetime
  note: / is default range separator; + or - sign is duration direction
  note: duration must begin with either + or - when used in end of range position
```

  The following table shows how ranges are calculated, given the different input parameters

-t parameter | range start | range end
--- | --- | ---
2016-06-24T18:42 | timestamp | now |
2016-06-24T18:42/2016-06-24T18:52:30 | timestamp | timestamp |
2016-06-24T18:42/+1d | timestamp | timestamp + duration |
2016-06-24T18:42/-1d | timestamp | timestamp |
2h30m8s | now - duration | now |
2h/+1h | now - duration1 | start + duration2 |
2h/-1h | now - duration1 - duration2 | now - duration1 |
5d10h25/2016-06-24T18:42 | now - duration | timestamp |

```
  note: all allowable datetime formats are also permitted when specifying ranges
  note: disallowed range separators:
       Y, y, M, D, d, H, h, m, S, s, -, +, P, p, T, t

Allowed "human" formats (all in local time):
    10 minutes ago
    yesterday at 12:30pm
    last night (night becomes 19:00)
    last month
    last friday at 2pm
    3 hours ago
    2 weeks ago at 17
    wednesday 2 weeks ago
    2 months ago
    last week saturday morning (morning becomes 06:00)
  note: "human" format can only be used instead of date-time
  note: it is not possible to express duration with "human" format (e.g. "from 2 to 3 this morining")
  note: it is recommended to avoid human format, as it may yield unexpected results
```

### **`logsene config set`**

``` bash
Usage: logsene config set [OPTIONS]
  where OPTIONS may be:
    --api-key <apiKey>
    --app-key <appKey>
    --default-size <size>
    --range-separator <sep>
    --trace <true|false>

It is not necessary to explicitly set api-key nor app-key.
Logsene CLI will ask you to log in and choose Logsene application
if keys are missing from the configuration
Examples:
  logsene config set --api-key 11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
      sets the api key for the current session

  logsene config set --app-key 22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222
      sets Logsene application key for the current session

  logsene config set --default-size 3000
      sets default number of hits returned for the current session (overrides the default 200)

  logsene config set --range-separator TO
      sets default separator of two datetimes for time ranges (default is /, as per ISO6801)

  logsene config set --trace [true]
      activates tracing for the current session (true can be omitted)

  logsene config set --trace false
      deactivates tracing for the current session
```
 

### **`logsene config get`**

``` bash
Usage: logsene config get [OPTION]  Where OPTION may be:
    --api-key
    --app-key
    --app-name
    --default-size (sets the default number of hits returned for the current session)
    --range-separator (used to separate start and end of a time range)
    --trace
    --all (return listing of all params from the current user's session)
```
