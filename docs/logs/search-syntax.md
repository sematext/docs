title: Sematext Logs Search Syntax
description: Create your own queries with Sematext logging management solution using terms and term modifiers, regular expressions, fuzzy searches, boolean operators, proximity and range searches, field grouping and more

Although Sematext's centralized logging management solution  provides the ability to create your own queries through
[its OpenSearch API](/docs/logs/search-through-the-opensearch-api), it also
provides a rich, yet simple query syntax very much like the query syntax
used by Google.

## Terms

A query is broken up into terms and operators. There are two types of
terms: Single Terms and Phrases.

A Single Term is a single word such as "test" or "hello".

A Phrase is a group of words surrounded by double quotes such as "hello
dolly".

Multiple terms can be combined together with Boolean operators to form a
more complex query (see below).

## Fields

When performing a search you can either specify a field, or use the
default field. The field names depend on how you've structured your
logs.

You can search any field by typing the field name followed by a colon
":" and then the term you are looking for.

As an example, let's assume your logs contain two fields, *message* and
*hostname. *If you want to find an event mentioning "connection closed"
from a host "foo.example.com", you can enter:

``` code
message:"connection closed" AND hostname:foo.example.com
```

Since *message* and *hostname* fields will be included in the default
field that is searched, which Sematext's centralized logging management solution creates for you behind the scenes, the field indicator is not required.

Note: The field is only valid for the term that it directly precedes, so
the query

``` code
message:connection closed
```

Will only find "connection" in the *message* field. It will find
"closed" in the default field.

## Term Modifiers

Our Logs Management App supports modifying query terms to provide a wide range of
searching options.

### Wildcard Searches

It also supports single and multiple character wildcard searches within
single terms (not within phrase queries).

To perform a single character wildcard search use the "?" symbol.

To perform a multiple character wildcard search use the "\*" symbol.

The single character wildcard search looks for terms that match that
with the single character replaced. For example, to search for "text" or
"test" you can use the search:

``` code
te?t
```

Multiple character wildcard searches looks for 0 or more characters. For
example, to search for test, tests or tester, you can use the search:

``` code
test*
```

You can also use the wildcard searches in the middle of a term.

``` code
te*t
```

Note: You cannot use a \* or ? symbol as the first character of a
search.

### Fuzzy Searches

It also supports fuzzy searches based on Damerau-Levenshtein Distance.
To do a fuzzy search use the tilde, "~", symbol at the end of a Single
word Term. For example to search for a term similar in spelling to
"roam" use the fuzzy search:

``` code
roam~
```

This search will find terms like foam and roams.

An additional (optional) parameter can specify the maximum number of
edits allowed. The value is between 0 and 2, For example:

``` code
roam~1
```

The default that is used if the parameter is not given is 2 edit
distances.

### Proximity Searches

Logging management app search supports finding words are a within a specific distance away. To
do a proximity search use the tilde, "~", symbol at the end of a Phrase.
For example to search for a "database" and "error" within 10 words of
each other in an event use the search:

``` code
"database error"~10
```

### Range Searches

Range Queries allow one to match events whose field(s) values are
between the lower and upper bound specified by the Range Query. Range
Queries can be inclusive or exclusive of the upper and lower bounds.
Sorting is done lexicographically.

``` code
timestamp:[20020101 TO 20030101]
```

This will find events whose timestamp fields have values between
20020101 and 20030101, inclusive. Note that Range Queries are not
reserved for date fields. You could also use range queries with non-date
fields:

``` code
customerName:{Adrian TO Brian}
```

This will find all entries whose customerName is between Adrian and
Brian, but not including Adrian and Brian.

Inclusive range queries are denoted by square brackets. Exclusive range
queries are denoted by curly brackets.

## Boolean Operators

Boolean operators allow terms to be combined through logic operators, supports AND, "+", OR, NOT and "-" as Boolean operators(Note: Boolean operators must be ALL CAPS).

### OR

The OR operator is the default conjunction operator. This means that if
there is no Boolean operator between two terms, the OR operator is used.
The OR operator links two terms and finds a matching event if either of
the terms exist in the event. This is equivalent to a union using sets.
The symbol || can be used in place of the word OR.

To search for events that contain either "error or "exception" use the
query:

``` code
error OR exception
```

### AND

The AND operator matches events where both terms exist anywhere in the
text of a single event. This is equivalent to an intersection using
sets. The symbol && can be used in place of the word AND.

To search for events that contain "database connection" and "timeout"
use the query:

``` code
"database connection" AND timeout
```

### \+

The "+" or required operator requires that the term after the "+" symbol
exist somewhere in a the field of a single event.

To search for events that must contain "database" and "connect" use the
query:

``` code
+database +connect
```

### NOT

The NOT operator excludes events that contain the term after NOT. This
is equivalent to a difference using sets. The symbol \! can be used in
place of the word NOT.

To search for events that contain "database connection" but not "failed
to" use the query:

``` code
"database connection" NOT "failed to"
```

Note: The NOT operator cannot be used with just one term. For example,
the following search will return no results:

``` code
NOT "failed to"
```

### \-

The "-" or prohibit operator excludes events that contain the term after
the "-" symbol.

To search for events that contain "database connection" but not "failed
to" use the query:

``` code
+"database connection" -"failed to"
```

## Grouping

Sematext's centralized logging management solution supports using parentheses to group clauses to form sub queries.
This can be very useful if you want to control the boolean logic for a query.

To search for either "database" or "solr" and "error" use the query:

``` code
(database OR solr) AND error
```

This eliminates any confusion and makes sure that text "error" must
exist and either term "database" or "solr" exist.

## Field Grouping

It also supports using parentheses to group multiple clauses to a single
field.

To search for a title that contains both the word "closed" and the
phrase "database connection" use the query:

``` code
message:(+closed +"database connection")
```
## Escaping Special Characters

Escaping special characters that are part of the query
syntax is another feature in our logs management app. The current list special characters are

\+ - && || \! ( ) { } \[ \] ^ " ~ \* ? : \\ /

To escape these character use the \\ before the character. For example
to search for (1+1):2 use the query:

``` code
\(1\+1\)\:2
```
