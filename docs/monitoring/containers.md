description: Monitor Docker and containerd containers, container orchestration systems like kubernetes, swarm and nomad, or cloud container orchestration services EKS, ECS, AKS, GKE with Sematext by installing simple Docker Certified Agents and using our interface that shows everything in one simple screen.

Monitor [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and containerd containers, container orchestration systems like kubernetes, swarm and nomad, or cloud container orchestration services EKS, ECS, AKS, GKE with Sematext by installing simple [Docker Certified Agents](https://hub.docker.com/_/sematext-agent-monitoring-and-logging) and using our interface that shows everything in one simple screen.

## Create a Sematext Monitoring App
Creating a Sematext Monitoring App is as easy as choosing the Infra integration and giving the App a name.

## Install the Sematext Agent
Sematext can easily monitor your containers with the Sematext Agent. [Installing](../agents/sematext-agent/containers/installation) the Agent is as simple as running one command on each host.

- [Docker](../agents/sematext-agent/containers/installation/#docker)
- [Docker Compose](../agents/sematext-agent/containers/installation/#docker-compose)
- [Docker Swarm](../agents/sematext-agent/containers/installation/#docker-swarm-enterprise)

## See Container data in Sematext Monitoring
Sematext Agent collects a plethora of metrics about hosts (CPU, memory, disk, network, processes), containers (Docker, containerd) and orchestrator platforms and ships that to Sematext Cloud.

You can see host and container metrics or have a high-level overview of all your containers in Infrastructure reports.
