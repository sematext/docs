## Install the Sematext Agent
Sematext can easily monitor your Infrastructure and Applications with the Sematext Agent. [Installing](../agents/sematext-agent/containers/installation) the Agent is as simple as running one command on each host.

Follow the Installation instructions when you create an App in Sematext to start shipping metrics.
