## Install the Sematext Agent
Sematext can easily monitor your Infrastructure and Applications with the Sematext Agent. [Installing](../agents/sematext-agent/containers/installation) the Agent is as simple as running one command on each host.

Follow the Installation instructions when you create an App in Sematext to start shipping metrics.

## See Application data in Sematext Monitoring
Sematext Agent collects a plethora of metrics about hosts (CPU, memory, disk, network, processes) and applications (Elasticsearch, JVM, Node.js, Redis, Nginx, and many more).

You can see host and container metrics inside the newly created Docker App or have a high-level overview of all your containers in the Sematext Containers screen.
