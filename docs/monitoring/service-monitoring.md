title: Service Monitoring
description: Sematext Service Monitoring helps you monitor the performance of all your services using one of our available integrations with automatic service discovery and monitoring capabilities.

Service Monitoring is for monitoring services' health status and performance metrics. Sematext Agent automatically discovers all services that can be monitored and displays them in [Fleet & Discovery > Services](https://apps.sematext.com/ui/fleet-and-discovery/discovery/services), where you can set up their monitoring without having to deploy or configure any additional agents.

Through a large number of readily available integrations, you get all the needed performance and health metrics in highly configurable dashboards or scheduled reports, specifically created for each service type. 

Each integration comes with prebuilt alerts based on fine-tuned thresholds, heartbeats, or anomalies detected by Sematext Cloud. No manual steps are needed for monitoring a service, everything is automatically discovered and configured through our service discovery functionality. Lastly, all the monitored services can be further correlated with their relevant logs to improve early identification of issues and time to resolution.
