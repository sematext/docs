## How do I get a new license

The SematextApps VM has an initial trial license that will expire in 30
days.  When the trial license or the real license expires, you will not
be able log into your Sematext Enterprise instance. To get a new license, please <a href="https://sematext.com/contact/">contact Sematext</a>.

## License expiry

All Sematext on-premises licenses are limited by their expiry date. As
expiry date approaches (and passes), license holders and owner of
default on-premises account will be notified by email.

After the license expires, you will be able to continue using
applications only for a few more days, so <a href="https://sematext.com/contact/">contact Sematext</a> early about the new license to avoid any service interruptions.

## How do Monitoring license limits work

Sematext Monitoring licenses have a limit on the concurrent number of
"server-apps". This "server-apps" is a combination of Monitoring App token and
server where Sematext Agent is installed. For example, if you have 4
servers, and on each of them you've installed 3 Monitoring App tokens, that is
counted as 12 server-apps (regardless of whether those servers use same
or different Monitoring App tokens).

If during the day your number of server-apps goes over the limit defined
by license, you will be notified by email and via a otification displayed
at the top of the Sematext UI. You will have until the end of the day (counted by
UTC timezone) to reduce the number of server-apps below the license
limit. If reduction doesn't happen until the end of the day, that day
will be counted as "over the limit" incident.

You are allowed to have a maximum of 4 such incidents over the trailing
30 days window. Once you have 5 or more such incidents over the last 30
days (check is done each day at 02:00 AM UTC), read-access to data will
be blocked. This means that performance metrics will continue to be collected
, but until the number of "over the limit" incidents falls back 
below 5 or you get a fresh license with higher limits, you will be
unable to view data in charts.

## How do Logs license limits work

Logs licenses have a limit on the volume of log data per
day. The limit is expressed in MB, GB, TB... per day, and is compared
with the total amount of log data used by all your Logs Apps
combined.

If during the day your volume of data goes over the license limit, you
will be notified by email and via a notification displayed at the top of
the Sematext UI. You will have time until the end of the day (counted by UTC
timezone) to reduce the amount of logs below the limit (e.g. by deleting
some data manually). If reduction doesn't happen until the end of the
day, that day will be counted as "over the limit" incident.

You are allowed to have a maximum of 4 such incidents over the trailing
30 days window. Once you hit 5 or more such incidents over the last 30
days (check is done each day at 02:00 AM UTC), read-access to data will
be blocked. This means that logs data will continue to be accepted,
but until the number of "over the limit" incidents falls back
below 5 or you get a fresh license with higher limits, you will be
unable to view data in charts.
