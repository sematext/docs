title: Fixing issues with check runs not showing up next to commits
description: A description of a potential issue that happens due to certain GitHub limitations, as well as instructions on how to circumvent the problem

Due to [limitations tied to GitHub's check-runs API](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/24616), sometimes manually created check runs can fail to show up even though the workflow itself executed, or get incorrectly added to the wrong check suite. Depending on your setup, you may experience this as well.

A way to circumvent this issue is by creating a private GitHub Application and using a [helper action](https://github.com/tibdex/github-app-token) which "impersonates" this Application to make it seem like it was what initiated the check runs.

The GitHub Application can be created:
- For your personal account, by clicking [here](https://github.com/settings/apps/new)
- For your organization
  - Navigate to your account settings
  - Click `Your organizations`
  - To the right of the organization, click `Settings`
  - In the left sidebar, click `<> Developer Settings`
  - In the left sidebar, click `GitHub Apps`
  - Click `New GitHub App`

Here are the steps you need to take in order to create your GitHub Application:
- Pick a fitting name that'll let you associate this with the testing suite, since it will be displayed as the name of your check runs next to commits
- For the Homepage URL field you can paste in whatever, since you won't really be using the action for anything aside from its tokens to "impersonate" it with
- Under `Webhook`, untick `Active`, since we won't need it
- Under `Permissions`, open up `Repository permissions` and add `Read and Write` to `Checks`, as well as `Read-only` to `Contents` (just like the Action itself requires)
- Create the GitHub Application

When you finish creating the App, you'll automatically be redirected to its overview.
- From here you need to copy the `App ID` found at the top of the page and save it as a repository secret called `GH_APP_ID` in the repository where you're having problems with checks not showing up
- Then, scroll down to the `Private keys` section and generate a private key
  - This will download a file containing the private key - open it with a text editor of your choice and copy the entirety of the file, then save it as a repository secret called `GH_APP_TOKEN`

Lastly, you have to install the GitHub Application you just created. You can do so by following [this short guide](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/using-github-apps/installing-your-own-github-app). Keep in mind how you created the Application - for your account or for your organization.

Now all you have to do is add these steps to the beginning of the workflow you use to invoke the Sematext CI/CD Action (before creating a Check Run):

```yaml
      - id: fetch_gh_app_token
        uses: tibdex/github-app-token@v2.1.0
        with:
          app_id: ${{ secrets.GH_APP_ID }}
          private_key: ${{ secrets.GH_APP_TOKEN }}

      - name: Set GH_TOKEN to the GH App token
        id: set_gh_token
        run: |
          # Use the GH App token to create the check run, to avoid GH API limitations with regard to check run grouping
          GH_TOKEN=${{ steps.fetch_gh_app_token.outputs.token }}
          echo "GH_TOKEN=$GH_TOKEN" >> $GITHUB_ENV
```

After adding them to the `repository_dispatch` workflow example, it should look like this:

```yaml
name: Deployment Complete Test

on:
  repository_dispatch:
    types: [environment_ready]

permissions:
  contents: read   # Required to access the repo
  checks: write    # Required to create a new check run

jobs:
  run-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # We'll manage most variables we need here
    env:
      MONITOR_GROUP_ID: 42                                       # Your Sematext Synthetics Monitor Group ID
      REGION: 'US'                                               # Your Sematext Cloud Region ('EU' or 'US')
      SEMATEXT_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.SEMATEXT_API_KEY }}          # Make sure to add your Sematext API key as a repository secret

    steps:

        with:

          private_key: ${{ secrets.GH_APP_TOKEN }}

      - name: Set GH_TOKEN to the GH App token
        id: set_gh_token
        run: |
          # Use the GH App token to create the check run, to avoid GH API limitations with regard to check run grouping
          GH_TOKEN=${{ steps.fetch_gh_app_token.outputs.token }}
          echo "GH_TOKEN=$GH_TOKEN" >> $GITHUB_ENV

          TARGET_URL="ASSIGN-YOUR-DEPLOYMENT-URL-HERE"
          echo "TARGET_URL is: $TARGET_URL"
          echo "TARGET_URL=$TARGET_URL" >> $GITHUB_ENV

That's it. Now run the workflow again to try it out. You should see the commit check, and its name should match the name of the GitHub Application you just created.
