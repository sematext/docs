title: Correlation
description: Split Screen is product-wide correlation and data-pivoting feature. With Split Screen you can compare selected Synthetics Monitor with any other report or dashboard, even the same report but with different filters in the two different screens.

### Manual Correlation

Manual correlation can be done using the [Split Screen](../guide/split-screen) feature. With [Split Screen](../guide/split-screen) you can compare and correlate selected Synthetic Monitor with any Monitoring, Logs, Infrastructure or Experience reports. Correlation is also possible with Events. It can be used to correlate even with the same Synthetic Monitor but with different filters in the two different screens.

Once you select a report you want to correlate with, it’ll be remembered so you can quickly toggle it.
