description: Getting started with Sematext Synthetics monitoring

To start monitoring your website or API, create a Sematext Cloud account in either EU or US and then:

 * [Click here](https://apps.sematext.com/ui/synthetics-create/app/Synthetics) to create the App in the US data center; or
 * [Click here](https://apps.eu.sematext.com/ui/synthetics-create/app/Synthetics) to create the App in the EU data center

You should see the form below:

/>


 * Fill in the App Name, usually the domain or API Endpoint will work great for this purpose
 * Enter the emails of your team members so that they're invited to the App if they don't have access to your account

After clicking Continue you will be taken to the next screen where you can create your first Synthetic monitor by clicking the **New Monitor** button in the top right corner of the page. You can then choose between creating an HTTP monitor and a Browser monitor, as shown in the screenshot below.
