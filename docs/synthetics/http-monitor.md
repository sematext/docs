title: HTTP Monitor
description: HTTP monitor can monitor any HTTP endpoint like API, Web URL, etc.

The HTTP monitor sends a single HTTP request with its configured request settings to the specified URL. It records the response data like headers, body, error if any and the various timings.

## Configuration

### General

* **Name** - Name of the monitor. Max length is 255 characters.
* **HTTP Method** - HTTP Method.
* **URL** - URL of the HTTP monitor of format `<http(s)>://hostname:port/path`.
* **Interval** - Monitor execution interval.
* **Locations** - List of locations to run the monitor.

### Request Settings

* **Authentication** - Fetch token for each run and pass it in your API requests, or pass username and password to connect to your protected APIs.
* **Headers** - List of HTTP headers to be sent.
* **Query Params** - List of request query parameters to be appended to the URL.
* **Cookies** - List of Cookies to be sent.
* **Body** - Request body data. Max length is 4096 characters.

Optionally, the **Header**, **Query Params**, and **Cookies** values can be marked as hidden, which means it will be hidden for the users. Currently, we do not encrypt the hidden values while storing it in the DB.

The max length of the **Header**, **Query Params**, and **Cookies** name and value fields are 512 and 1024 characters respectively. A maximum of 100 entries for each is allowed.

By default, the HTTP monitor adds the headers below for all requests sent from the agent:

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `x-sematext-origin` | `synthetics` | Origin of the request. Can be used to identify Synthetics requests in the back end or filter the requests in a firewall. |
| `x-sematext-synthetics-id` | `<run-id>` | Uniquely identifies this request. Can be used for tracing and correlation in the back end. |


### Response Settings

* **Save Response Body** - Disable this option to prevent response body from being saved at runtime. This can be helpful to ensure no sensitive data gets featured in your test results.

If you disable this option, we **wonâ€™t save the response body** hence it **will not be shown** on the Run details screen.

## Authentication

### Bearer / Access Token

You can **dynamically fetch a token** for each run with token support and pass that token in your API requests. 

When creating an HTTP monitor, navigate to the Authentication tab and select **Bearer/Access Token** authentication option.

![Access Token Authentication](../images/synthetics/authentication-token.png)

Enter the access token URL and the source field to get the token from response. Enter body parameters to fetch the token such as grant-type, username and password.

Before Sematext calls the endpoint, an access token will be fetched based on the parameters entered within this tab and it will be passed to the API request.

### Basic Authentication

You can select the **Basic Authentication** option within the Authentication tab and add the username and password needed to connect to your **protected APIs**.

### NTLM Authentication

You can select the **NTLM Authentication** option within the Authentication tab and enter your credentials. Both NTLMv2 and NTLMv1 are supported.

You can also fill in the optional **Domain** and **Workstation** fields in the **Advanced Configuration** section, if those are required for your setup. If no advanced configuration is specified, default empty values will be auto-generated.

### Header-based Authentication

HTTP monitors also support header-based authentication. You can specify custom HTTP request headers when creating a monitor.

For instance, if you need to monitor an endpoint using an API key, you can include it as a custom request header, like so:

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `API_KEY` | `XYZ` |

For Basic authentication using only headers, follow these specifications to add a custom request header:

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Authorization` | `Basic XYZ` | **XYZ** is the **Base64** encoding of the **username:password** string. |

After **Base64** encoding the string `username:password` above would become `dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=`. This is then prepended with `Basic` to get the final `Authorization` header value of `Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=`.

So if your username was `username` and your password was `password`, then your `Authorization` header would look as follows:

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `Authorization` | `Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=` |

It is possible to get the **Base64** encoded value of your `username` and `password` by using the following command in a terminal, where you should replace `username` with your username and `password` with your password:

```
echo -n "username:password" | base64
```

You can also get the **Base64** encoded value of your `username` and `password` by using an online **Base64** encoder/decoder such as [base64encode.org](https://www.base64encode.org).

## Conditions

Alert conditions can be configured on the response fields and metrics. The conditions are evaluated for every run result. All the conditions should pass for a run to be declared as passing. If any condition fails, the run will fail and the monitor will be marked as failing. The supported alert condition types for HTTP monitors are:

* **Error** - During each run, if there's an error like connection, timeout, etc., it will be recorded in the error field of the response. This does not include the error returned as part of the response body.
* **Response Code** - HTTP Status Code. Used to make sure the response code should be of specific value or range.
* **Metric** - Used to make sure the metrics are within the expected range.
* **Response Header** - Can be used to compare the value of a specific header field against the expected value.
* **Response Body** - Compare the response body against the specified value using an operator.
* **Response Body JSON** - If the response body is JSON, [JSONPath](https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath) can be used to extract a specific value and compare against the expected value. More information on how to set up these conditions is provided in the [next subsection](#configuring-custom-alerts-based-on-json-response).

Various operators like **Equals**, **Less Than**, **Greater Than**, **Contains** are supported based on condition type.
These conditions define the alert rule for your monitor. You can choose the priority of the alert rule right below the table where the alert conditions are edited. The default priority for HTTP monitor alert rules is **Warning**. For more information on alerting, refer to the [Creating Synthetics Alerts](/alerts/creating-synthetics-alerts) page.

By default, the UI adds the below conditions while creating an HTTP monitor. You can change them during the creation:

* **Error** *equals* **empty**
* **Response Code** *equals* `200`
* **Response Time** metric *less than* **20000 ms**


### Configuring Custom Alerts based on JSON response
In addition to our preconfigured alert conditions, you can also create your own based on the JSON returned in the response body. This can be done using the **Response Body JSON** type, where [JSONPath](https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath) can be used to extract a specific value and compare it against the expected value.

Let's say that you have an API which returns information about the internal status of your services. When everything is working fine, this is the response you get:

```json
{
  "results":[
    {
      "name":"Database",
      "status":"OK"
    },
    {
      "name":"Redis",
      "status":"OK"
    },
    {
      "name":"Elasticsearch",
      "status":"OK"
    }
  ],
  "serviceStatusCode":"0"
}
```

In the event where one of the services encounters issues, its status will change from `OK` to `Error`, like so:

```json
{
  "results":[
    {
      "name":"Database",
      "status":"OK"
    },
    {
      "name":"Redis",
      "status":"Error"
    },
    {
      "name":"Elasticsearch",
      "status":"OK"
    }
  ],
  "serviceStatusCode":"2"
}
```

With this JSON structure in mind, you can define a **Response Body JSON** alert condition like in the image below.

![Custom Alert Condition](../images/synthetics/custom-alert-condition.png)

The field is defined as `$.results[:].status`, meaning that all the `status` fields inside of `results` will be checked, and the monitor run will fail if any of them are equal to `Error`. Here's an example of a run failing upon one of these services reporting an error.

![Custom Condition Failing](../images/synthetics/custom-alert-condition-fail.png)


## Run environment

Each HTTP monitor run is executed in an isolated environment. [Go HTTP Client](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/) library is used to execute the HTTP requests. Each run is allocated 128MB memory. The response body is trimmed to 2 MB.

The default values for various timeouts are:

* **Socket Connection Timeout** - 10 seconds.
* **TLS Handshake Timeout** - 10 seconds.
* **Total Timeout** - Timeout for complete request-response operation - 25 seconds.
