description: App Sharing is restricted only to a particular app. Nothing besides the shared app is accessible to the invited user for example, dashboards are at the account level can can thus be shared only through Account Sharing.

App guests is **restricted only to a particular App**. Nothing besides the 
shared App is accessible to the invited user. 

*__Note__: Dashboards are at the account level can can thus be shared only through Account Members.*

This option is useful if you want to be restrictive about which Apps can be 
seen by others or what kind of effect they have on your team. 

By only configuring App guests, guests **can't see or edit alert rules** created 
by your team, they **can't use your team's notification hooks**, meaning they're 
**limited only to the App they have access to**.

To share one of your Apps with other users, go to the 
[App guests page](https://apps.sematext.com/ui/team/app-guests) on Sematext Cloud.
