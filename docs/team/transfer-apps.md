title: Sematext Transfer Apps
description: Inviting team members to your account means they get access to all your Apps, dashboards, notification hooks, alert rules, and everything else!

Only App Owner can change an App ownership by transferring that App to another user. To transfer the 
ownership of an App, use the Transfer Apps feature. Click the **Start Ownership Transfer** 
button to open the flyout, select an App, click **Transfer to...** to proceed, enter the email of the
user you want to transfer the App to, and hit **Transfer Ownership**.

*__Note__: Apps can be transferred only to existing Sematext users.*

To transfer one of your Apps to another user, go to the 
[Transfer Apps page](https://apps.sematext.com/ui/team/transfer-apps) in Sematext Cloud (or [Transfer Apps in Sematext Cloud EU](https://apps.eu.sematext.com/ui/team/transfer-apps)).
